## What is the model for
Example: the code explores different techniques and parameters for predicting if PV and HP has been installed in a house or not. This is done by using the electricity time series of the building. model receives time series of electricity consumption for one year with 15 mins time steps and predicts if PV and/or heat pump has been installed in the associated building.

## How does the model work
Example: the model is a classifier that is trained using gradient boosting with tunes parameters.
